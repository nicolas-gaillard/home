# Home

A collection of configuration files for a version-controlled Mac workspace that I can clone anywhere.

## Getting Started

```
cd
git clone https://https://github.com/nicolazg/home home
```

The cleanup script for OSX is coming from this [repo](https://github.com/fwartner/mac-cleanup).

## Installing

*Full instalation*
```
cd home
./install.sh
```

*Just copying files*
```
cd home
./copy.sh
```

## Upgrade & cleaning

`cd home ; ./cleanup.sh`
